# Project-0_Tamagotchi

A Tamogatchi Mushroom game, where the user is tasked with keeping their tamogatchi mushroom alive by regularly feeding it, putting it to sleep, and playing with it. Technologies used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unsolved problems: getting the timer to show minutes and seconds, rather than just continuing to increment in seconds.

I also definitely didn't commit as often as I should have. 

User Story:
When I load the page, I see an image of my tamagotchi mushroom in the middle of the screen.

At the top of the screen I see an input field that says “enter your tamagotchi’s name”. Next to it, there is a button that says “submit.”

In the upper-right corner of the screen, there is a start button and right below it is a timer that is set to 0.

Below this, I see four metrics: hunger, sleepiness, boredom, and age. Each metric is set to 0.

There are three buttons below the mushroom that say feed, lights off, and play. 

I enter my tamagotchi’s name and click the submit button. When I do, a message appears that says "Click the Start button to wake [name]".

I click the start button and the timer starts counting up.

Every 2 minutes, my tamagotchi gets one year older and the age goes up by 1.

Every 30 seconds, boredom increases by 1.

Every 40 seconds, hunger increases by 1

Every 60 seconds, sleepiness increases by 1.

When I click the play button, boredom decreases by 1.

When I click the feed button, hunger decreases by 1.

When I click the lights off button, sleepiness decreases by 1.

When any of my metrics hits 10, the game ends and a message appears letting me know that my tamogatchi has died.

App functionality: It's working pretty well! The metrics all start counting up when the timer starts and the buttons work well to decrement those values.

Triumphs: I'm really excited to have gotten the timer/buttons/metrics all to work. I'm also really happy with the styling I was able to put together.

Challenges: Surprisingly, the CSS was quite challening for this. I also couldn't figure out how to get the timer to reflect minute and seconds, rather than just seconds.

Words of Wisdom: Sometimes it helps to go back to the foundation and work your way back through the code.
